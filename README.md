# Remote-Floating-Trash-Collector

This repository contains the source code and design files for a remotely operated floating trash collector. The device uses radio frequency communication, a conveyor belt system, and weight sensors to efficiently collect and measure floating debris in water bodies. The project aims to prevent drainage clogging and facilitate the cleaning of waterways.

This repository contains the following essential files to help you set up and understand the project:

INO File: This file contains the Arduino code for the hardware component of the project, which you can upload to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

Schematic Diagram: A visual representation of the hardware connections and components is provided as an image file, offering a clear understanding of how the hardware is set up.
