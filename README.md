# Remote-Floating-Trash-Collector

This repository contains the source code and design files for a remotely operated floating trash collector. The device uses radio frequency communication, a conveyor belt system, and weight sensors to efficiently collect and measure floating debris in water bodies. The project aims to prevent drainage clogging and facilitate the cleaning of waterways.
